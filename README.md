#Summary
Library Acquisitions refer to a library response for the selection and purchase of materials or resources. Acquisitions may be impacted by budget, library space, materials format, resources price, users’ preference, etc. There are several ways to acquire materials: purchase, subscriptions, interlibrary loan, gifts, etc.

Our primary goal in the project is to simulate the possibility of acquisitions outcome focusing on physical materials (books) and e-resources. The project has two steps: creating preliminary simulation along with physical books. In the preliminary simulation, we consider two main variables: a thickness of a book and the price of each book. After testing the preliminary simulation, we develop the simulation with physical materials and e-resources including e-books, online journals, and databases.

In the developed simulation, we consider four main variables. First, contract conditions—purchase or subscription. To be specific, while paying once per an item, the subscription can be a fixed expenditure that needs to be sustained. Second, the limitation of physical space. Libraries sometimes purchase the same materials in both physical and digital; however, if the library space may not be enough to store for new materials, the library may consider purchasing e-book only. Third, the overall budget should be considered. For example, if a library would like to purchase as many items as they can, they might consider e-resource more than physical books because of physical books generally more expensive than e-books. In addition, the budget allocated by the library to physical books and electronic resources is different.. The more budget that physical books take, the less budget left for e-books. Also, this budget problem is directly related to the first variable, contract conditions. Finally, we also consider subscription new e-resources or cancellation of e-resources depending on users’ needs.

 
#Hypothesis
1.     In terms of physical materials only, space and budget may not remarkably impact a possible purchased number of materials and total price.

2.     In terms of both physical materials and e-resources, the contract on purchase or subscription of digital materials may crucially impact a possible purchased number of materials, but total price does not presented differently.
